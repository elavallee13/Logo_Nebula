"LogoNebula: The Future of SVG Designs"


Our task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG fileLinks to an external site.. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

# Motivation

My motivation for this project is to create an application that creates an SVG file for the user. This allows the user to easily generate custom logos in SVG image format.

# Why did you build this project?

 I built this project to assist creators with an essencial part of the project process. 
 Having a custom logo to repersent the users project not only allows the creator to display the brand and creator of the application but also allows the user to easily create an logo in SVG format.

# What problem did you solve?

This project solves the issue for the creator by easily creating a logo.

# What did you learn?

What I learned in this application is how to effectively use node.js to create a program that can create a logo for developers. I also learned key points on what goes into making a command line project that creates logos for users.

## Usage 

Terminal - node logo-generator.js - The user is promted to answer a few questions for how they want their logo to appear. These questions include font size and color, logo shape and background color and a three character entry for the title.

## Credits

I owe the credits of this projects to the instructors of this course, my peers, and learning material found on 

## License

 I did not use a license for this project. 


## Features

The features I created with this project allow the user to be prompted with professional preloaded questions to answer about their project. These questions are demoed in the current README that you are viewing.

## How to Contribute

I contribute the help for this project to my professors and TAâ€™s that assist us with the needed information to help us complete assignments.

## Tests

To test this project I used the command in terminal - node index.js
This test proved to ask the required questions for a professional readme file that automatically creates said file ready for publishing.
